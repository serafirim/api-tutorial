My code that I wrote after learning from [a post on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-call-web-apis-with-the-useeffect-hook-in-react) about calling web APIs with the useEffect Hook in React. This is vital to the survival as a React developer. What spawned me onto what to learn this is, a product I am working on, [MERNStackStarter](https://github.com/serafirim/MERNStackStarter), has states and I was confused about what was going on.
